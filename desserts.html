<h2>DESSERTS</h2>
<p>Dessert is the sweet course eaten at the end of a meal. The term “dessert” can apply to many confections, such as cakes, tarts, cookies, biscuits, gelatins, pastries, ice creams, pies, puddings, custards, and sweet soups. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness.</p>
