<h2>WINES</h2>
<p>Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide, and heat. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine.</p>
<h4>FIVE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WINE</h4>
<ol>
    <li>The oldest known recipe is for a 4,000-year-old beer made by the Sumerians.</li>
    <li>In the 1980s, Anchor Brewing re-created these ancient Fertile Crescent suds.</li>
    <li>Sumeria’s neighbors, the Egyptians, built the pyramids under the influence. Workers at Giza received about four liters of beer a day, according to Patrick McGovern, a biomolecular archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania.</li>
    <li>Beer (in part because it contains antimicrobial ethanol) was a healthier drink than polluted Nile river water.</li>
    <li>Ethanol, the intoxicant in beer, is a powerful antiseptic, but not a good cold remedy. The optimal blood alcohol content to kill germs would be more than 60 percent. Alas, that’d kill you, too. (Fatal alcohol poisoning occurs between 0.40 and 0.50 percent.) </li>
